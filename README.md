# MorseCodeDecoder_with_CharacterWordSentenceAnalyser
we are going to adopt the same set of representation for the Morse Code used in the first assignment based on the binary digits. The ‘dots’ are represented by the digit 0 and the ‘dashes’ are represented by the digit 1. As for the spaces, they are represented by the character ‘*’. Note that our representation of Morse Code encodes the standard 26 letters (i.e. ‘A’ to ‘Z) and the 10 numerals (i.e. ‘0’ to ‘9’), with three additional punctuation characters (i.e. the period ‘.’; the comma ‘,’; and the question mark ‘?’).
